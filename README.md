### About Me

I am a budding scientist with a knack for solving problems using code. Originally from Detroit, MI.

### My Work

My work ranges from basic data science in biology to pharmacometrics.

Some of my most recent projects include work in the areas of:

**Current:**

*Bioinformatics*
- Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC, or Liver Cancer)
- RNA-seq
- Functional Enrichment

*Pharmacometrics*
- Model Informed Drug Design (MIDD)
- Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP)

**Past:**

- Cancer Immunogenicity
- Autologous Cell Therapies
- Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
